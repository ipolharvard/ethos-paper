MIMIC-IV Clinical Database Demo
===============================

The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database is comprised
of deidentified electronic health records for patients admitted to the Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center. Access to MIMIC-IV is limited to credentialed users.
Here, we have provided an openly-available demo of MIMIC-IV containing a subset
of 100 patients. The dataset includes similar content to MIMIC-IV, but excludes
free-text clinical notes. The demo may be useful for running workshops and for
assessing whether the MIMIC-IV is appropriate for a study before making an access
request.

For details on the data, see the MIMIC-IV project on PhysioNet:
https://doi.org/10.13026/07hj-2a80

The contents of this project also contain an additional file:
demo_subject_id.csv

This is a CSV file containing the subject_id used to filter MIMIC-IV. Only
these subject_id are available in the demo.
